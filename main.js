/* 
Complete the function that accepts two integer arrays of equal length.
Adds the value of each member in one array to the corresponding member in the other.
Squares the sum of the two values.
Returns the average of those sums rounded up.

Example
    [2,2] [2,2] => 16 (because 16 + 16 divided by 2 equals 16)
